# REZO development handoff

This file is the starting context for the next Codex task working on REZO. Read
it together with [`BUILD_PERFORMANCE.md`](BUILD_PERFORMANCE.md) and
[`Rezo_Feature_Ideas_By_Complexity.md`](Rezo_Feature_Ideas_By_Complexity.md)
before changing the design.

## 2026-08-03 optimization update

The behavior-preserving journal optimization pass is complete. The final
netlist preserves the version-1 record bytes, slot-local addressing, dual-sector
selection, CRC verification, UI/DSP behavior, and four-cycle physical CS# gap.
It replaces retained header metadata and wide byte muxes with streamed
validation/serialization, and reuses otherwise idle journal registers for
pending generation, CRC, validity, sector, and address state.

Final measured resources (`OPT-JOURNAL-FOLDED-ADDR`):

- LUT4: 19,742 (570 fewer than SAVE-ONE-CLICK-S4)
- Packed cells: 23,206 / 24,288
- Free packed cells: **1,082** (578 more than SAVE-ONE-CLICK-S4)
- FF: 6,373 (206 fewer)
- BRAM: 13 / 56 (unchanged)

The exact same synthesized `top.json` passed all clocks at three seeds:

| Seed | DVI5X MHz | AUDIO MHz | SYNC MHz | DVI MHz |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 8 | 411.18 | 75.60 | 65.42 | 77.41 |
| 4 | 389.71 | 74.59 | 65.31 | 77.57 |
| 2 | 488.28 | 73.17 | 67.74 | 76.60 |

The user powered down the rack during this task and explicitly requested no
flash. **Do not claim this optimization has been hardware-tested or flashed.**
The next hardware action is a supervised slot-4 flash followed by boot,
audio/UI, restore, and SAVE DEFAULT smoke tests.

No roadmap feature was implemented in this pass. With 1,082 free cells, a
minimal forward-only shift-register prototype is now reasonable, but it should
be introduced incrementally: clock threshold/hysteresis, one CV source, ten
values, atomic publication, and no reverse/ping-pong/random/reset extensions.
See the new capacity checkpoint in `Rezo_Feature_Ideas_By_Complexity.md`.

## Repository state

- Repository: `/Users/naenyn/git/tiliqua`
- Branch: `rezo`
- Optimization parent: `6a4a4ab1 rezo: persist default state in active slot`
- `Erica Resonant FB Notes.txt` is an untracked, user-owned reference file at
  the repository root. Do not delete, stage, or commit it unless explicitly
  requested.
- The optimization parent commit adds the tested full-state default journal, active-slot
  discovery, flash timing recovery, persistence tests, one-click SAVE DEFAULT,
  and the latest build-log entries.

## User working preferences and safety rules

- Do not revert to a previous implementation without asking. Diagnose and fix
  forward; this is an exploratory passion project and preserving useful work is
  more important than quickly returning to an older build.
- Flashing REZO is allowed when needed. Use slot 4 unless the user says
  otherwise. Never hardcode slot 4 into persistence logic: persistent state
  must always use the bootloader-validated slot from which REZO is running.
- Do not change the UI as part of an optimization unless the user approves the
  UI change first. Internal implementation changes that preserve the displayed
  pixels and control behavior are encouraged.
- Preserve audio behavior during performance work. Add or extend tests before a
  risky refactor and compare the DSP path bit-for-bit where practical.
- Keep the user informed during long builds; FPGA routing may take a long time.
- Never treat a small source change as a small hardware change. This design is
  congested and placement is highly seed-sensitive.

## Current product state

REZO is a CPU-free, lean 1280x720p60 Tiliqua R5 bitstream running audio at
192 kHz. Its major implemented features are:

- Ten time-multiplexed resonator bands.
- BANK mode with editable bipolar band levels, factory shapes/presets,
  resonance, feedback, and resonator drive.
- FILTER mode that uses the ten bandpass resonators to approximate low-pass,
  high-pass, band-pass, and notch responses, with frequency, continuously
  variable slope, width, resonance, and drive.
- BANK input assignment: each physical input can be audio or CV. Audio inputs
  are mixed with individual gain; CV inputs can target resonance, feedback, or
  one of four band groups with attenuverters.
- FILTER modulation matrix: IN1-IN3 can each modulate frequency, resonance,
  width, slope, and drive through signed depths.
- Four band groups and per-band group assignment.
- Four-output routing matrix with independent unipolar send levels for each
  group and dry signal.
- Per-band feedback-send enable controls and feedback safety controls.
- Base/effective modulation visualization: unmodulated values retain a marker
  and modulation is shown using the semantic modulation palette role. This is
  implemented for BANK bands and controls and FILTER controls, including
  drive.
- Five semantic color palettes. The selected palette is now part of the saved
  REZO default state rather than an independently autosaved preference.
- One-click `SAVE DEFAULT` on the ADVANCED page. There is intentionally no
  confirmation state. A successful record restores the complete current REZO
  state when the same bitstream slot is booted again.

The user hardware-tested the pre-optimization save/restore workflow
successfully. That implementation was also flashed to slot 4. The archive
filename
used for the last flash carried the previous commit ID because the persistence
changes were uncommitted at build time; those exact changes are now commit
`6a4a4ab1`.

## Persistence safety and implementation notes

Persistence caused a bootloader scare during development, so changes here
must be treated carefully.

- The journal reserves only the two 4 KiB option sectors belonging to the
  active, bootloader-validated slot.
- No arbitrary software-provided flash address is accepted.
- An invalid or unavailable boot-slot record disables saving safely.
- Records are dual-sector, generation-numbered, versioned, CRC-checked, and
  verified after programming.
- Version 1 currently saves 42 16-bit state words (84 payload bytes), while the
  on-flash format reserves room for up to 2 KiB of future state.
- State capture/restore uses a circular 42-cycle scan stream to avoid a large
  addressable UI-state mux.
- The snapshot memory must remain inferred as block RAM. Distributed RAM cost
  roughly 700 packed cells in an earlier experiment.
- The SPI bridge enforces four full 60 MHz cycles of physical CS#-high recovery
  between flash transactions. The original one-cycle gap produced SAVE ERROR
  and no committed record. Do not weaken this timing without hardware-level
  evidence and tests.
- The earlier boot failure was never conclusively explained. The present
  bounded addressing and hardware-tested journal work, but any persistence
  refactor should first prove all erase/program addresses remain inside the
  current slot's option window.

## Build-performance discipline

`BUILD_PERFORMANCE.md` is a required rolling engineering log, not optional
documentation. For every materially different synthesized/routed design:

1. Record the source change or experiment ID.
2. Record the placement seed.
3. Record LUT4, packed cells, free cells, FF, and BRAM.
4. Record every final post-route clock result: DVI5X, AUDIO, SYNC, and DVI.
5. Keep failed experiments and aborted/pathological routes in the notes so the
   same dead end is not repeated.
6. Do not compare pre-route timing estimates as though they were final timing.
7. Run more than one seed for an important candidate when time permits.

Formal historical optimization baseline (`OPT-BASE`, commit `2b464d50`, seed
4):

- LUT4: 18,282
- Packed cells: 21,668 / 24,288
- Free packed cells: 2,620
- FF: 5,894
- BRAM: 10 / 56
- DVI5X: 404.53 MHz (required 371.33)
- AUDIO: 64.35 MHz (required 49.15)
- SYNC: 64.86 MHz (required 60.00)
- DVI: 79.56 MHz (required 74.25)

Previous one-click-save build (`SAVE-ONE-CLICK-S4`, seed 4):

- LUT4: 20,312
- Packed cells: 23,784 / 24,288
- Free packed cells: **504** (about 2.1%)
- FF: 6,579
- BRAM: 13 / 56
- DVI5X: 396.35 MHz (pass)
- AUDIO: 74.48 MHz (pass)
- SYNC: 64.87 MHz (pass)
- DVI: 78.11 MHz (pass)

The optimized build passes at seeds 8, 4, and 2 with 1,082 free cells. This is
enough to begin a deliberately minimal clocked-mode prototype, but not enough
to accumulate multiple roadmap items without measuring each one. Packed-cell
use and routing success are
not monotonic with source-code size. Seed 8 became pathological for the final
one-click netlist; routing the exact synthesized `top.json` with seed 4 passed.
DVI5X is largely the existing TMDS serializer and is highly seed-sensitive,
but overall packing congestion is also a real constraint.

## Test baseline

The complete targeted regression set now contains 27 passing tests, including
an explicit record-programming test across a 256-byte flash page boundary:

```sh
pdm run pytest \
  tests/test_rezo_ui.py \
  tests/test_rezo_display.py \
  tests/test_rezo_persistence.py \
  tests/test_rezo_compare_path.py \
  tests/test_i2c.py
```

Run from `gateware/` if the repository's PDM command expects that directory.
Also run `git diff --check` before builds and commits.

Normal build command:

```sh
TILIQUA_REZO_SEED=<seed> pdm run rezo build --fs-192khz
```

Normal flash command from `gateware/`:

```sh
pdm flash archive build/rezo-r5/<archive>.tar.gz --slot 4 --noconfirm
```

Only flash a routed build after every required clock passes. When evaluating
seeds of an unchanged synthesized design, reuse the exact `top.json` for direct
nextpnr routing so synthesis variation is not confused with placement
variation.

## Immediate next task: supervised hardware validation

1. Flash the final passing archive to slot 4 only when the user is present and
   the rack is powered.
2. Confirm boot, audio, all pages, palette rendering, and modulation display.
3. Confirm the previously saved version-1 default restores unchanged; the
   optimization intentionally kept the on-flash format byte-identical.
4. Exercise SAVE DEFAULT, reboot slot 4, and confirm the complete state restores.
5. If hardware passes, begin the minimal clocked shift-register foundation as
   a separate measured feature build. Do not add the later direction/random/
   reset extensions in the same netlist.

## Desired next functionality

The next major desired feature is a clocked shift-register mode. The roadmap
ranks it as moderate complexity. The likely foundation is a shared,
time-multiplexed control-rate band transformation engine:

```text
manual/preset levels
    -> shape source
    -> rotate / tilt / morph
    -> motion or clocked source
    -> existing group and CV modulation
    -> smoothing
    -> ten time-multiplexed resonators
```

For shift-register mode, plan for:

- A physical input configured as clock, with threshold and hysteresis.
- A source value (probably another CV input initially) shifted into one end of
  the ten-band vector.
- Atomic publication of a completed ten-band state so the audio engine never
  sees a partially shifted vector.
- Forward direction first; reverse, ping-pong, random, and reset are later
  enhancements.
- Existing base/effective modulation visualization should consume the computed
  state rather than adding arithmetic to the pixel renderer.
- State fields must be versioned and included in SAVE DEFAULT only after the
  basic mode is stable.

Before implementing it, settle the minimal first-version interaction with the
user. A new mode/page or altered input page is a UI change and requires
approval. The performance pass is now complete; hardware-validate it before
spending the recovered cells.

Lower-risk features that may fit before or alongside that foundation are more
factory preset shapes and a simple band-enable mask. Tilt, rotate, randomize,
random walk, diffusion, LFO phase spreading, and more advanced spectral modes
should still be isolated from the first shift-register build so their measured
costs do not become entangled.

## Longer-term direction

The full ranked roadmap is in `Rezo_Feature_Ideas_By_Complexity.md`. Important
product goals discussed with the user include:

- Continue supporting BANK and FILTER modes rather than copying the Erica
  module exactly.
- Preserve resonance as a primary, immediately accessible control.
- More characterful but controlled resonance/feedback/drive behavior.
- Potentially configurable band frequencies and frequency-layout presets.
- Additional motion features such as tilt, rotation, LFO phase spread, random
  walk, diffusion, and shift-register operation.
- Future user presets or multiple saved states, after the single default-state
  journal is proven and resource headroom exists.
- Potential stereo or multiple-audio-input workflows, assignable CV, and
  richer output routing; these are substantially larger than simple
  control-rate transformations.
- A CLOCK or SHIFT REGISTER mode is currently more important than scopes or a
  spectrum analyzer. Visual analysis features remain low priority.

The guiding constraint is to keep REZO musically interesting and visually
coherent while maintaining 720p60 HDMI timing and substantial modulation
capacity. Optimize shared machinery before adding parallel copies of feature
logic.
